# A record class that represents axis-aligned rectangles in a coordinate plane. That plane
# is nominally the xz plane of a 3 dimensional coordinate system because of the
# application I developed this class for, but clients can actually map it to any plane
# they want. In any case, I represent these rectangles by their minimum and maximum
# coordinates in each dimension, so that the fields available to clients are named "minX,"
# "minZ," "maxX," and "maxZ."
